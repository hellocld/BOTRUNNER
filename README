BOTRUNNER is my first attempt at making a decent game. It's a 15 stage, 2D platformer created using AS3 and Flixel. Feel free to use any of the crappy code here for anything you like, as well as the graphics/stages/audio. Just be sure to give me a little mention in the credits of your project or something.

You can play BOTRUNNER and my other games and such at http://hellocld.com

Best,
